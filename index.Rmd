I am a PhD candidate in the School of Journalism and Media at the University of Texas at Austin. I am also a graduate research assistant at the [Center for Media Engagement](https://mediaengagement.org). I study political communication with a special focus on Latin America and diaspora communities in the United States. I work mainly with computational methods and interviews, and I really enjoy applying them both in mixed-methods research.

I have 12 years of professional experience as a journalist. I have reported on-camera as Texas correspondent for Globo TV, a Brazilian media conglomerate and the largest TV network in Latin America. I have also worked for ten years hosting a Web TV and TV show focused on live music in Brazil.
