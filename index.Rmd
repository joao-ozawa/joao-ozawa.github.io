Joao Ozawa is a Ph.D. candidate in the School of Journalism and Media at the University of Texas at Austin. He is also a Graduate Research Assistant at the Center for Media Engagement.

Ozawa focuses on two main lines of research. First, he studies authoritarian attacks against journalism in Latin America. Second, he investigates political communication, with a particular emphasis on (1) Latin America, (2) its interactions with the United States, and (3) Latin American diaspora communities in the United States. Ozawa works mainly with computational methods and interviews, and applies them both in mixed-methods research. On computational methods, he uses R for time series analysis, natural language processing, topic modeling, data visualization, data collection, and statistical analysis in general.

Ozawa has 10 years of professional experience as a journalist. He has reported on-camera as Texas correspondent for Globo TV, a Brazilian media conglomerate and the largest TV network in Latin America. He worked for eight years hosting a Web TV and TV show focused on live music in Brazil.
